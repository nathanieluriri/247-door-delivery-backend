# Compliance & Background Checks

## Plan
- Ingest background check results per driver and link to documents.
- Block activation until mandatory docs + background check are approved.
- Add admin review endpoint to view check status/history.
- Audit-log every status change for compliance artifacts.

## Checks (Done When)
- Background check data model stored and linked to driverId.
- Activation guard enforces background check approval.
- Admin can view and update check outcomes.
- Audit entries recorded for each compliance decision.
