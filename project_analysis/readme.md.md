# Analysis for readme.md

## Summary
- README is a template for a scaffolding tool rather than this project.

## Potential issues / gaps
- Does not document this backend's setup, env vars, or run instructions.
- No API overview, database schema, or deployment guide for ride-hailing use case.

## Notes
- Should be replaced with project-specific documentation.
