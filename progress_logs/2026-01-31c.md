# Progress Log – 2026-01-31 (Env & Follow-up)

- Updated `.env` to use Cloudflare R2 via S3-compatible settings (STORAGE_BACKEND=s3, endpoint/bucket/keys set).
- Added new todos for AV scanning/IAM and integration/load testing to track remaining work.
- Existing todos left in-progress; none marked complete this round.
- Added structured logging middleware to emit JSON request logs with ride/driver/rider context and duration.
- Removed completed observability todo and opened a focused metrics/alerts rollout todo.
- Pruned completed/in-progress todos and created a refreshed, condensed todo set (storage security, tests/CI, notifications, background checks, observability).
- Added domain metrics (match time, driver accepts, payment failures, SSE backlog) and wired to exporter; updated observability todo to note metrics done.
- Added hashing (SHA256/MD5) to storage layer and metadata tags for R2 uploads; presigned URLs remain.
- Refreshed storage security todo to focus on AV/quarantine, hash persistence, and IAM rotation; added AV/IAM-specific todo.
