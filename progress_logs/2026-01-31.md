# Progress Log – 2026-01-31

## What I did
- Added driver document upload + storage endpoints; admin review endpoint with audit logging.
- Implemented audit log repository/service; wired into admin ban/approve flows and doc reviews.
- Hardened ride acceptance concurrency rules; validated generic update API; filtered unverified drivers from matching.
- Added driver presence cleanup job and account-status-aware presence tracking to keep stale/offline drivers out of discovery.

## Where I stopped
- Document upload currently stores files locally under `uploads/documents/{driverId}`; consider moving to S3 and adding virus scanning.
- Notification SMS/email fallbacks still rely on existing infra; no dedicated dead-letter queue yet.
- Load/integration tests still TODO; CI hook not added.

## Next up (suggested)
- Add background check ingestion and tie driver activation to document approval results.
- Expand metrics/alerts for dispatch and payments; wire to observability stack.
- Write integration tests for ride flow + Stripe webhook paths.
