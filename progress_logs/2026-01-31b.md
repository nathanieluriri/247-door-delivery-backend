# Progress Log – 2026-01-31 (Phase 2)

## Work completed
- Swapped driver document storage to pluggable backend with S3 + presigned URLs; AV scan stub added (`core/storage.py`).
- Updated driver document schema/service/routes to use storage keys instead of local paths.
- Added background check model/service and admin endpoint; activation now requires PASSED check.
- Added basic notification resilience stubs (DLQ/retry hooks) for push/SMS.
- Instrumented FastAPI with Prometheus metrics exporter and JSON logging config.
- Added unit tests for ride status transitions and pricing; created CI GitHub workflow.

## Pending/risks
- Notification providers (push/SMS) are stubs—wire to real services.
- AV scanning uses stub; integrate real scanner or service in production.
- S3 credentials required when `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`.
- Background checks auto-created but ingestion from provider not wired yet.

## Next steps
- Implement provider integrations for SMS/push and AV scanning.
- Add integration tests for storage + background check approval path.
- Expand metrics/alerts definitions and dashboards.
